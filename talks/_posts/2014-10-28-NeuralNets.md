excerpt: Quick notes on Neural Nets

Neural nets are very cool:

* Example of biologically inspired algorithms. For others, see 
* Famous for learning from unstructured data;
* Famous for learning concepts even when the target
  concept is not known before the learning starts;
+ Before our CPUs got very fast, neural nets were famous for slow training times, but very fast run times. Much loved by the process control
  community since, to run a network, you only need a matrix of notes and matrix of weights between nodes.

More generally, neural nets are an example of
_biologically inspired intelligence_; i.e.
theories, methods, and technologies for designing
software and hardware systems that are inspired upon
biological processes and mechanisms.

+ Studies how bio-inspired systems can help to understand biological systems.
