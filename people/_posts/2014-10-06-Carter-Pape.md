I am an undergraduate in pursuing both Computer Science and Physics. I would like to one day be a professor. I have a passion for teaching, and it would be nice to also have the chance to work on research in the field of Computer Science. I like the theory of computer science, such as automata, computability theory, and all that stuff. I want to solve the P versus NP problem. That is my ultimate academic goal, really.

I blog, so feel free to [check out what I have written](https://medium.com/@carterpape). I may one day write about computer science and such, but really, I've just written about subjects that matter to me and about which I feel I can write well.
