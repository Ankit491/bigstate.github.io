Hi, I am Anant Agarwal, a graduate student in the Dept. of Computer Science here at NC State. My area of interest are Distributed Systems, Machine Learning and Data Science. I am fluent in C++ and Python. I love working with different technologies and almost always keep myself busy with some MOOC. 

I am joining VMware as a Software Engineer in February 2015 and I will be working with their High Availability team. I was intern their the previous Summer and I had a great time. Bay Area is a fantastic place for engineer with it's wide offering of hackathons, meetups etc. It's a programmer's paradise. I hope to start my own start-up some day and plan to work in the core R&D departments developing awesome products and algorithms.

Please feel free to email me at aagarwa7@ncsu.edu. I tweet using the handle [@anant_agarwal](http://twitter.com/anant_agarwal) and I maintain my github repos at [@anantag](http://github.com/anantag). I also maintain my web-presence at [anantag.github.io](http://anantag.github.io) though I don't get to update it frequently.
