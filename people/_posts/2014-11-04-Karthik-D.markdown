Hey all, I am Karthik, a CS graduate student at NC State and I will be graduating in 2016. I am into Data Mining, Machine Learning and Software Development. Having just finished my undergrad at the College of Engineering Guindy, Chennai in India, I am floored by the so many new things I am exposed to, at NC State.

I love to develop and make new stuff. I have participated in a few hackathons so far, having made a few apps and learnt so many new technologies at the end of them. I am comfortable in C and C++ and am currently learning R and Python.

I am an eager learner and one day, hope to become a useful member of the Computer Science fraternity and give back to the world, from which I have taken so much from.
