I am a grad student pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from NC State University. I have a keen interest in Data Driven Learning and hence a goal to become a successful data scientist. I did my undergrad in Computer Science & Engineering from VIT, Vellore from India in 2012. I have a two years of work experience as a Software Engineer in a Bangalore based start-up company where I have worked on building fraud detection modules on banking domain. Most of my work is in Java and related frameworks. But I love to learn new technologies and languages because I think that learning new concepts widens our thought process. These days, I am learning R, a language well suited for statistical computation. My codes and projects are public and maintained in github repos at [@abhiabhi15](https://github.com/abhiabhi15).
